# 2D-Array-Operations-Sorting-Each-Column-in-Descending-Order
This C++ program allows the user to input elements into a 2D array and sorts each column individually in descending order. It first takes input for the array's dimensions and elements, displays the original matrix, and then displays the updated matrix after sorting each column from top to bottom in descending order.
